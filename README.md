Use Case A use case is a description of how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal. It outlines the steps involved in completing a task and the expected outcome. Use cases are often used in requirements gathering and system design to identify the functional requirements of a system.

Example: A customer uses an online shopping platform to purchase a product. The use case would describe the steps the customer takes, such as searching for the product, adding it to the cart, and checking out.

Communication Diagram A communication diagram, also known as a collaboration diagram, is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that shows the interactions between objects or components in a system. It highlights the relationships and communication patterns between these entities.

Example: A communication diagram for an e-commerce system might show the interactions between the customer, the shopping cart, the payment gateway, and the inventory management system.

System Sequence Diagram A system sequence diagram is a type of UML diagram that shows the sequence of events and interactions between systems or components over time. It provides a chronological view of the system's behavior and helps identify the flow of events and data.

Example: A system sequence diagram for an online banking system might show the sequence of events when a customer logs in, views their account balance, and initiates a transfer.

Class Diagram A class diagram is a type of UML diagram that shows the relationships and structures of classes or objects in a system. It defines the properties, methods, and relationships between classes, providing a static view of the system's structure.

Example: A class diagram for a simple banking system might show the classes for Customer, Account, and Transaction, along with their attributes and relationships.
